After completing the assignment, be sure to push to Github and Heroku.
Please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your web application (e.g., Heroku):

    Your video was so helpful!  Thank you so much!  I wouldn't have figured all 
    of that out on my own.

    https://git.heroku.com/cse341-lebaron.git

    https://cse341-lebaron.herokuapp.com/

2. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):

    https://github.com/jenlebaron/cse341.git

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. 

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?
    I have a hard time anytime we are having to use and install new programs.  It is probably user 
    error but things just don't go smoothly for me.  It would be helpful if they gave and actual 
    link to the website on what we should use for MongoDB.  And a video that is up-to-date on what 
    the website looks like so we know we are on the correct one. 

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
   1 - Some attempt was made
   2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
   3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
   4 - Meets requirements
   5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category
