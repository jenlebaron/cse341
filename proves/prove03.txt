After completing the assignment, be sure to push to Github and Heroku.
Please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your web application (e.g., Heroku):

    I tried to follow your video and had a lot of errors.  So I 
    decided to focus on the assingment that needed to be done and work on this next week.

2. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):

    https://github.com/jenlebaron/cse341.git

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. 

    I completed all of the tasks

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.

    To my knowledge they are all working.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.

    I like learning about how to add and delete products.

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?

    The videos are so long and it is hard to work and listen at the same time.  It makes for 
    hours and hours of work on this class.  Way more than the 9-12 hours that it should be.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
   
   5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.

    The fact that I got this done with being gone on vacation half the week is a miracle.
