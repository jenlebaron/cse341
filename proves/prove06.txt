    I like adding extra validation to the code that hepls the user know what they need to fix.

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?

    I wish there was better comunication in reguards to pushing to git hub with a token and making

    see the email without it crashing with git hub.

   5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.

    This week was a good week for me with the reading.  I understand the validation and 
    error process because I learned that last semester.  I was able to follow along and 
    get my code to work without getting help.  I do have a question, if I get my homework 
    done before you grade the prior week, am I able to push it to heroku and not mess up 
    last weeks grading?
